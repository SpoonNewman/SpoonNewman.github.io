> I build projects to learn, explore ideas, and get better at writing software.

## About

I build tools and projects that help me learn by doing. My recent work includes a Rust-based CLI tool, infrastructure experiments with Terraform and cloud APIs, and side explorations in C#. I enjoy digging into systems, discovering how things work under the hood, and gaining experience across languages and environments.

**Note:** At this time, while I still hold a passion for writing software, I am pursuing a separate career path.

> This site is a simple place to show some of my most interesting projects and to point to my foundation of knowledge.
