> Junior Software Engineer — interested in building fast, reliable systems and learning new technologies.

## About

I’m a junior software engineer with experience across multiple projects and technologies.
I enjoy working on problems that involve performance, correctness, and thoughtful design.
At this time, while I still hold a passion for writing software, I am pursuing a separate career path.

This site is a simple place to show some of my most interesting projects and to point to my foundation of knowledge.

## Projects

### [Drone-CLI](https://github.com/SpoonNewman/drone-cli.git)

This repository is a tandem effort with a close friend. I was tasked with building a CLI tool to interact with a drone over an API.  
Development is slow, but active.

**Tech: Rust**

### [The-Box](https://github.com/SpoonNewman/The-Box.git)

This repository was created to learn and practice Terraform.
