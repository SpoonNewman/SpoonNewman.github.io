# Rease Kessler

Junior Software Engineer  
Interested in building fast, reliable systems and learning new technologies.

## About

I’m a junior software engineer with experience across multiple projects and technologies.
I enjoy working on problems that involve performance, correctness, and thoughtful design.
At this time, while I still hold a passion for writing software, I am pursuing a separate career path.

This site is a simple place to show of some of my most interesting projects, and to point to my foundation of knowledge. 

## Projects

## Drone-CLI
This repositort is a tandem effort with a close friend. I was tasked with the job of making a CLI tool to interact with a drone over an API. This is still in development, while the development is slow, it is active.
**Tech: Rust**
